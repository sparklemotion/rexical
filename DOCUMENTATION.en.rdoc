  Lexical Scanner Generator for Ruby, with Racc.


== Usage

  rex [options] grammarfile

  -o  --output-file  filename   designated output filename.
  -s  --stub                    append stub main for debug.
  -i  --ignorecase              ignore char case
  -C  --check-only              syntax check only.
      --independent             independent mode.
  -d  --debug                   print debug information
  -h  --help                    print usage.

== Default Output Filename

  It destinate from foo.rex  to foo.rex.rb.
  This name is for a follow description.

    require 'foo.rex' 


== Grammar File Format

  A definition is given in order of a header part, a rule part, 
  and the footer part.  One or more sections are included in a rule part.
  As for each section, the head of the sentence starts by the keyword.

  Summary:

    [Header Part]
    "class" Foo
    ["option"
      [options] ]
    ["inner"
      [methods] ]
    ["macro"
      [macro-name  regular-expression] ]
    "rule"
      [start-state]  pattern  [actions]
    "end"
    [Footer Part]


=== Grammar File Example

    class Foo
    macro
      BLANK         \s+
      DIGIT         \d+
    rule
      {BLANK}
      {DIGIT}       { [:NUMBER, text.to_i] }
      .             { [text, text] }
    end


== Header Part ( Optional )

  All the contents described before the definition of a rule part are 
  posted to head of the output file.


== Footer Part ( Optional )

  All the contents described after the definition of a rule part are 
  posted to tail of the output file.


== Rule Part

  Rule part is from the line which begins from the "class" keyword 
  to the line which begins from the "end" keyword.
  The class name outputted after a keyword "class" is specified.
  If embellished with a module name, it will become a class in a module.
  The class which inherited Racc::Parser is generated.


=== Rule Header Example

    class Foo
    class Bar::Foo


== Option Section ( Optional )

  "option" is start keyword.

    "ignorecase"  when pattern match, ignore char case.
    "stub"        append stub main for debug.
    "independent" independent mode, for it is not inherited Racc.


== Inner Section ( Optional )

  "inner" is start keyword.
  The contents defined here are defined by the inside of the class 
  of the generated scanner.


== Macro Section ( Optional )

  "macro" is start keyword.
  One regular expression is named.
  A blank character (0x20) can be included by escaping by \ .


=== Macro Section Example

    DIGIT         \d+
    IDENT         [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*
    BLANK         [\ \t]+
    REMIN         \/\*
    REMOUT        \*\/


== Rule Section

  "rule" is start keyword.

  [state]  pattern  [actions]


=== state: Start State ( Optional )

    A start state is expressed with the identifier which prefaces ":".
    When the continuing alphabetic character is a capital letter, 
    it will be in an exclusive start state.
    When it is a small letter, it will be in an inclusive start state.
    Initial value and default value of a start state is nil.


=== pattern: String Pattern

    The regular expression for specifying a character string.
    The macro definition bundled with { } can be used for description 
    of a regular expression.  A macro definition is used in order to use 
    a regular expression including a blank.


=== actions: Processing Actions ( Optional )

    Action is performed when a pattern is suited.
    The processing which creates a suitable token is defined.
    The arrangement whose token has the second clause of classification 
    and a value, or nil.
    The following elements can be used in order to create a token.

      lineno    Line number     ( Read Only )
      text      Matched string  ( Read Only )
      state     Start state     ( Read/Write )

    Action is bundled with { }.  It is the block of Ruby.
    Don't use the function to change the flow of control exceeding a block.
    ( return, exit, next, break, ... )
    If action is omitted, the character string which matched will be canceled 
    and will progress to the next scan.


=== Rule Part Example

        {REMIN}                 { state = :REM ; [:REM_IN, text] }
  :REM  {REMOUT}                { state = nil ; [:REM_OUT, text] }
  :REM  (.+)(?={REMOUT})        { [:COMMENT, text] }
        {BLANK}
        -?{DIGIT}               { [:NUMBER, text.to_i] }
        {WORD}                  { [:word, text] }
        .                       { [text, text] }

== Comment ( Optional )

  From "#" to the end of the line becomes a comment in each line.


== Usage for Generated Class

=== scan_setup()

    The event for initializing at the time of the execution start of a scanner.
    It is redefined and used.


=== scan_str( str )

    Parse the string described by the defined grammar.
    Token is stored in an inside.


=== scan_file( filename )

    Parse the file described by the defined grammar.
    Token is stored in an inside.


=== next_token

    One token stored in the inside is taken out.
    The last returns nil.


== Notice

  This specification is provisional and may be changed without a preliminary 
  announcement.
